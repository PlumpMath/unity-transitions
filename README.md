# Unity3D-transitions
shader transitions in Unity3D.

## This was programmed in Unity3D version 5.3.5, and Visual Studio 2015.
There is a little more info about this on my [website](http://cynicalstudios.com/transitions-and-shaders-in-unity3d/)

To use this package you can clone down the repository
```
https://github.com/cynical89/unity-transitions.git
```

or you can download the .unitypackage [HERE](https://github.com/cynical89/unity-transitions/releases/tag/1.0.0)

You need to import the files into unity and you are set to enjoy.

The original shader and transtitions are from http://danjohnmoran.com. I have included the original shader in the project and all his transitions. I then modified the shader and added a couple images and sprites to allow the transition that I wanted. I then programmed the animation in C# to allow the notification bar to appear on the screen, animate from the center out, and then disappear within 4 seconds.
